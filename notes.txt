Run in a Venv

Create the Venv (first time only)
> make

Activate the venv
> source activate-venv

Deactivate the venv
> deactivate





More details on setting up venv (Handled by Makefile)


> python3 -m venv ~/epics-env   # runs Python's built-in virtual environment creator
                                # new environment is stored in /home/epics-env

What it creates inside ~/epics-env/:
A private copy of the Python interpreter.
A bin/ folder with its own python and pip executables.
A lib/ folder for packages you install (separate from system packages).

> source ~/epics-env/bin/activate   #activates the venv (shell prompt will change to (epics-env)


Install packages inside it
> pip install "numpy<2" matplotlib pyepics cothread scipy


Created a requirements.txt so all packages are installed in one go:
> pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
